    # Run +cmd+.
    #
    # If the command succeeds (i.e. returns 0), its output will be returned
    # with a trailing newline stripped, if there was one. If the command fails
    # (i.e. returns a non-zero value), nil will be returned.
    #
    # If a block is given, it will be yielded once the command has run, with a
    # Babushka::Shell object as its sole argument. Details of the shell command
    # are contained in this object - see the methods +cmd+, +ok?+, +result+,
    # +stdout+, and +stderr+.
    #
    # Several options can be provided to alter #shell's behaviour.
    #   <tt>:sudo => true</tt> runs the the command as root. If the command
    #     contains piping or redirection, a 'sudo su' variant will be used
    #     instead so that the pipe receiver or redirect targets are also
    #     included in the sudo.
    #   <tt>:as => 'user'</tt> causes sudo to run as the specified user instead
    #     of root.
    #   <tt>:sudo => 'user'</tt> is a shortcut that has the same effect as
    #     <tt>:sudo => true, :as => 'user'</tt>
    #   <tt>:cd</tt> specifies the directory in which the command should run.
    #     If the path doesn't exist or isn't a directory, an error is raised
    #     unless the <tt>:create</tt> option is also set.
    #     To achieve the directory change, the command is rewritten to change
    #     directory first: `cd #{dir} && #{cmd}`.
    #   <tt>:create</tt> causes the directory specified by the <tt>:cd</tt>
    #     option to be created if it doesn't already exist.
    #   <tt>:input</tt> can be used to supply input for the shell command. It
    #     be any object that can be written to an IO with <tt>io << obj</tt>.
    #     When passed, it will be written to the command's stdin pipe before
    #     any output is read.
    #   <tt>:spinner => true</tt> When this option is passed, a /-\| spinner
    #     is printed to stdout, and advanced whenever a line is read on the
    #     command's stdout or stderr pipes. This is useful for monitoring the
    #     progress of a long-running command, like a build or an installer.

    # of +#shell+. In fact, +#sudo+ constructs a sudo command, and then uses
    # +#shell+ internally to run the command.
    #
    # All the options that can be passed to +#shell+ are valid for +#sudo+ as
    # well. The :sudo and :as options can be ommitted, though, which will cause
    # the command to be run as root. Hence, this sudo call:
    #   sudo('ls')
    # is equivalent to these two shell calls:
    #   shell('ls', :sudo => true)
    #   shell('ls', :as => 'root')
