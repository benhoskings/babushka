    # Run +cmd+.
    #
    # If the command succeeds (i.e. returns 0), its output will be returned
    # with a trailing newline stripped, if there was one. If the command fails
    # (i.e. returns a non-zero value), nil will be returned.
    #
    # If a block is given, it will be yielded once the command has run, with a
    # Babushka::Shell object as its sole argument. Details of the shell command
    # are contained in this object - see the methods +cmd+, +result+, +stdout+
    # and +stderr+.
    #
    # Several options can be provided to alter #shell's behaviour.
    #   <tt>:sudo => true</tt> runs the the command as root. If the command
    #     contains piping or redirection, a 'sudo su' variant will be used
    #     instead so that the pipe receiver or redirect targets are also
    #     included in the sudo.
    #   <tt>:as => 'user'</tt> causes sudo to run as the specified user instead
    #     of root.
    #   <tt>:sudo => 'user'</tt> is a shortcut that has the same effect as
    #     <tt>:sudo => true, :as => 'user'</tt>
    #   <tt>:cd</tt> specifies the directory in which the command should run.
    #     If the path doesn't exist or isn't a directory, an error is raised
    #     unless the <tt>:create</tt> option is also set.
    #     To achieve the directory change, the command is internally updated
    #     to something like `cd #{dir} && #{cmd}`.
    #   <tt>:create</tt> causes the directory specified by the <tt>:cd</tt>
    #     option to be created if it doesn't already exist.
    #   <tt>:input</tt> can be used to supply input for the shell command. It
    #     be any object that can be written to an IO with <tt>io << obj</tt>.
    #     If it is passed, it will be written to the command's stdin pipe
    #     before any output is read.
    #   <tt>:spinner => true</tt> When this option is passed, a /-\| spinner
    #     is printed to stdout, and advanced whenever a line is read on the
    #     command's stdout or stderr pipes. This is useful for monitoring the
    #     progress of a long-running command, like a build or an installer.

    # This method is a shortcut for accessing the results of a shell command
    # without using a block. The method itself returns the shell object that
    # is yielded to the block by +#shell+.
    # As an example, this shell command:
    #   shell('grep rails Gemfile') {|shell| shell.stdout }.empty?
    # can be simplified to this:
    #   failable_shell('grep rails Gemfile').stdout.empty?

    end

    # Run +cmd+ in a separate interactive shell. This is useful for running
    # commands that depend on something shell-related that was changed during
    # this run, like changing the user's shell. It's also useful for running
    # commands that are only valid on an interactive shell, like rvm-related
    # commands.

    # Run +cmd+ via sudo.
    #
    # The return behaviour and block handling of +#sudo+ are identical to that
    # of +#shell+. In fact, +#sudo+ constructs a sudo command, and then uses
    # +#shell+ internally to run the command.
    #
    # All the options that can be passed to +#shell+ are valid for +#sudo+ as
    # well. The :sudo and :as options can be ommitted, though, which will cause
    # the command to be run as root. Hence, this sudo call:
    #   sudo('ls')
    # is equivalent to these two shell calls:
    #   shell('ls', :sudo => true)
    #   shell('ls', :as => 'root')
    #
    # In the same manner, this sudo call:
    #   sudo('ls', :as => 'ben')
    # is equivalent to these two shell calls:
    #   shell('ls', :sudo => 'ben')
    #   shell('ls', :as => 'ben')

    # This method returns the full path to the specified command in the PATH,

    # For example, on a stock OS X machine:
    #   which('ruby')     #=> "/usr/bin/ruby"
    #   which('babushka') #=> nil
    #
    # This is roughly equivalent to using `which` or `type` on the shell.

    # platforms and shells, we instead use the logic in #cmd_dir.

    #   cmd_dir('ruby')     #=> "/usr/bin"

    # This is a direct implementation because the behaviour and output of
