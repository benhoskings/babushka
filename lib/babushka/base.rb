module Babushka

  # +host+ is an instance of Babushka::SystemProfile for the system the command
  # was invoked on.
  # If the current system isn't supported, SystemProfile.for_host will return
  # +nil+, and Base.run will fail early. If the system is known but the
  # flavour isn't (e.g. an unknown Linux variant), a generic SystemProfile
  # will be used, which should work for most operations but will fail on deps
  # that attempt to use the package manager, etc.
