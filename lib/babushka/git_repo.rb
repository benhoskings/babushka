  # Provides some wrapper methods for interacting concisely with a git
  # repository.
  #
  # The repo is accessed by shelling out to `git` via the {repo_shell}
  # method, which makes sure the repo exists and that the commands are run
  # in the right place. Hence, GitRepo doesn't depend on your current
  # working directory.
  #
  # Most of the methods return a boolean and are used to discover things
  # about the repository, like whether it's {clean?} or {dirty?}, currently
  # {merging?} or {rebasing?}, and whether it's {ahead?} or {behind?} the
  # default remote.
  #
  # Some return a piece of data, like {current_head} and {current_branch}.
  #
  # There are also some methods that make simple changes to the repository,
  # like {checkout!} and {reset_hard!}.
  #
  # To perform other operations on the repository like committing or
  # rebasing, check out grit. This class is just a little `git` wrapper.
