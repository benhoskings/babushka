    # Run this dep and its subdeps recursively.

    # The overall flow for a single dep is [met? [, meet, met?]]. That is,
    # met? is checked; if it's false, meet is run and then met? is checked
    # again.
    #
    # The [meet, met?] component for unmet deps is only performed if +and_meet+
    # is true. If it's false, then babushka will just check met? down the tree,
    # returning true if this dep and all its subdeps are already met.
    #
    # Running the dep involves the following steps:
    # - First, the +setup+ block is run.
    # - Next, the dep's dependencies (i.e. the contents of +requires+) are
    #   run recursively; this dep early-exits if any of the subdeps couldn't be
    #   met (or if this is a dry run, if any of the subdeps are unmet).
    # - If the dependencies are all met, the +met?+ block is run. If +met?+
    #   returns +true+, or any true-like value, the dep is already met and
    #   there is nothing to do. Otherwise, the dep is unmet, and the following
    #   happens:
    #     - The +prepare+ task is run.
    #     - The +before+ task is run.
    #     - If +before+ returned a true-like value, the +meet+ task is run.
    #       This is where the actual work of achieving the dep's aim is done.
    #     - If +meet+ returned a true-like value, the +after+ task is run.
    # - Finally, the +met?+ task is run again, to check whether running +meet+
    #   achieved the dep's goal.
    #
    # The final step is important to understand: the +before+/+meet+/+after+
    # blocks' return values are ignored. The result of a dep is always that of
    # its +met?+ block, whether it was already met, became met after the meet
    # block was run, or couldn't be met.
    #
    # Sometimes there are conditions under which a dep is unmeetable. For
    # example, if a dep detects that the existing version of a package is
    # broken in some way that requires manual intervention, then there's no
    # use running the +meet+ block. In this circumstance, the dep can call
    # +#unmeetable!+, which raises an +UnmeetableDep+ exception. Babushka will
    # rescue it and consider the dep unmeetable (that is, it will just allow
    # the dep to fail without attempting to meet it).
    #
    # The following describes the return values of the defining components, and
    # of the dep itself.
    # - A '-' means the corresponding block wouldn't be run at all.
    # - An 'X' means the corresponding value doesn't matter, and is discarded.
    #
    #     Scenario            | met?         | -> meet      | -> met? | dep returns
    #     --------------------+--------------+--------------+---------+------------
    #     already met         | true         | -            | -       | true
    #     met during run      | false        | X            | true    | true
    #     couldn't be met     | false        | X            | false   | false
    #     failure during meet | false        | #unmeetable! | -       | nil
    #     unmeetable          | #unmeetable! | -            | -       | nil
    #
    # Wherever possible, the +met?+ test shouldn't directly test any work done
    # in the +meet+ block, only that its overall purpose has been achieved.
    # Just like normal test-driven development, you should test the "what" and
    # not the "how". Tests involving the "how" are brittle and don't correctly
    # express the dep's intent.
    #
    # For example, if the purpose of a given dep is to make sure the webserver
    # is running, the contents of the +meet+ block would probably involve
    # `/etc/init.d/nginx start` or similar, on a Linux system at least. In this
    # case, the +met?+ block shouldn't test anything involving `/etc/init.d`
    # directly; instead, it should separately test that the webserver is
    # running, for example by using `lsof` to check that something is listening
    # on port 80.
