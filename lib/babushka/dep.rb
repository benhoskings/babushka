    # Trigger a dep run with this dep at the top of the tree.
    #
    # Running the dep involves the following:
    # - First, the +setup+ block is run.
    # - Next, the dep's dependencies (i.e. the contents of +requires+) are
    #   run recursively by calling +#process+ on each; this dep's +#process+
    #   early-exits if any of the subdeps fail.
    # - Next, the +met?+ block is run. If +met?+ returns +true+, or any
    #   true-like value, the dep is already met and there is nothing to do.
    #   Otherwise, the dep is unmet, and the following happens:
    #     - The +prepare+ task is run
    #     - The +before+ task is run
    #     - If +before+ returned a true-like value, the +meet+ task is run.
    #       This is where the actual work of achieving the dep's aim is done.
    #     - If +meet+ returned a true-like value, the +after+ task is run.
    #     - Finally, the +met?+ task is run again, to check whether running
    #       +meet+ has achieved the dep's goal.
    #
    # The final step is important to understand. The +meet+ block is run
    # unconditionally, and its return value is ignored, apart from it
    # determining whether to run the +after+ block. The result of a dep is
    # always taken from its +met?+ block, whether it was already met,
    # unmeetable, or met during the run.
    #
    # Sometimes there are conditions under which a dep can't be met. For
    # example, if a dep detects that the existing version of a package is
    # broken in some way that requires manual intervention, then there's no
    # use running the +meet+ block. In this circumstance, you can call
    # +#unmeetable!+, which raises an +UnmeetableDep+ exception. Babushka will
    # rescue it and consider the dep unmeetable (that is, it will just allow
    # the dep to fail without attempting to meet it).
    #
    # The following describes the return values of a few components, and of
    # the dep itself.
    # - A '-' means the corresponding block wouldn't be run at all.
    # - An 'X' means the corresponding return value doesn't matter, and is
    #   discarded.
    #
    #     Initial state   | initial met?         | meet  | subsequent met? | dep returns
    #     ----------------+----------------------+-------+-----------------+------------
    #     already met     | true                 | -     | -               | true
    #     unmeetable      | UnmeetableDep raised | -     | -               | false
    #     couldn't be met | false                | X     | false           | false
    #     met during run  | false                | X     | true            | true
    #
    # Wherever possible, the +met?+ test shouldn't directly test that the
    # +meet+ block performed specific tasks; only that its overall purpose has
    # been achieved. For example, if the purpose of a given dep is to make sure
    # the webserver is running, the contents of the +meet+ block would probably
    # involve `/etc/init.d/nginx start` or similar, on a Linux system at least.
    # In this case, the +met?+ block shouldn't test anything involving
    # `/etc/init.d` directly; instead, it should separately test that the
    # webserver is running, for example by using `netstat` to check that
    # something is listening on port 80.
